> [I] didn't know anything about programming before and Iâ€™'m very happy
> with this class and amazed that I could write something that works.

> Assignments were helpful, well written, and relevant. Lecture was
> clear and informative. The final project is a great way to let loose
> and internalize concepts.

> A great introduction to a broad and complex topic.

> After this class I feel that I really have acquired a basic
> understanding of [Python] and am ready to solve some real problems
> with it.

> Ethan's ability to tailor assignments specifically to help reinforce
> lecture information is excellent. The workload in the course was
> perfect - assignments were challenging and required a reasonable
> amount of time to complete, but were incredibly helpful in helping to
> understand and become familiar with the information.
