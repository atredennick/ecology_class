### Course Description
 



### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic biology.


### Purpose of Course

In this course you will learn how life on Earth came to be, what makes populations
of species go up and down through time and space, how so many species can 
coexist, and why ecological systems are vital for making our planet livable for
humans. Essentially, you will learn what makes the nature tick. Along the way you
will learn some basic mathematical modeling skills and how to perform analyses
in the statistical program ``R``.


### Course Goals and Objectives

Students completing this course will be able to:

* Understand and explain foundational ecological concepts
* Use critical thinking skills to solve problems
* Write simple ecological models in ``R``
* Be scientifically literate, and be able to effectively communicate scientific
  ideas
* Apply the above skills to address novel ecological questions


### How this course relates to the Student Learning Outcomes in blank

This course contributes to the...


### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using a flipped, learner-centered, approach, because
many of the concepts and problems we will be working on will require time
actively simulating ecological dynamics on a computer or by hand. 
Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but they
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If you're interested in
knowing more take a look at this great
[info-graphic](http://www.knewton.com/flipped-classroom-2/).


### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Each week will
begin with students watching a video from [Crash Course: Ecology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNdTKZkV_GiIYXpV9w4WxbX). 
Classes will involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by working on exercises in
class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve. For more challenging topics class may start with 20-30
minute demonstrations on the concepts followed by time to work on exercises.


## Course Policies


### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However,
experience suggests that students who regularly miss class struggle to learn the
material.


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizes, and 2 exams (one mid-term, one final). The final will be
cumulative in the sense that course topics will build on previous material.
Most of your grade will come from weekly or bi-weekly assigments.


### Make-up policy

Late assignments will be docked 20% and will not be accepted more than 48 hours
late except in cases of genuine emergencies that can be documented by the
student or in cases where this has been discussed and approved in advance.
Time has been allotted in class for working on assignments and students are expected to work
on them outside of class. It is intended that you should have finished as much
of the assignment as you can based on what we have covered in class by the
following class period. Therefore, even if something unexpected happens at the
last minute you should already be close to done with the assignment. This policy
also allows rapid feedback to be provided to students by returning assignments
quickly.


### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Monday night by 11:59 pm Mountain Time. Assignments should be
submitted via -------.


### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free and open
source software on those laptops. Support will be provided by the instructor in
the installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you with
one.


## University Policies


### University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities

TBD


### University Policy on Academic Misconduct

Link to university code of conduct.


### Etiquette and Communication Courtesy

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common
courtesy in all email messages, discussions, and group work.


## Getting Help

TBD

Most importantly, if you are struggling for any reason please come talk to me
and I will do my best to help.


## Grading Policies

Grading for this course will revolve around a combination of assignments (50%),
exams (25%), and an independent project (25%).

There will be 11 equally weighted assignments. One problem from each assignment
(selected at the instructors discretion after the assignments have been
submitted) will receive a thorough review and a detailed grade. Other
problems will be graded as follows:

* Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
* Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect
    answer: 90%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept:
    50%
* Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%

Independent projects will focus on a review of a foundational concept in ecology.

go through the semester, those plans may need to change to enhance the class
learning opportunity. Such changes, communicated clearly, are not unusual and
should be expected.
